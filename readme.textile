h1. Titanic Machine Learning Exercise

This is my work (in progress) on Kaggle's introductory machine learning exercise.

The task is to account for who survived the Titanic disaster on the basis of passenger demographic data & information about the ticket each passenger bought.

I'm doing my analysis in R.

<h3> Important Note</h3>
In the real world, this would not be a good question to tackle with machine learning.  Better to figure out how to prevent these disasters from occuring in the first place (use strong rivets that won't pop off in glancing collisions with icebergs, don't drive the boat too fast), but nevertheless prepare for the unlucky event that a disaster comes to pass (carry adequate lifeboats for everyone on board, rehearse safety procedures).
